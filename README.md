# YALLA
_**Y**et **A**nother **L**ame **L**ibrary of **A**lgorithms_* is an ever growing collection of algorithms and data structures used in **machine learning** and large scale **data processing**, implemented from scratch for fun and profit.

## What's the point
As any field progresses, new tools and libraries are created to make our lives easier. They help us turn ideas into working products faster and with better quality. They achieve this thanks to an ever increasing level of abstraction. Unfortunately high level of abstraction comes with a cost. It becomes easy to miss or loose grasp of the inner workings of particular tools, models and algorithms.

This repository is an attempt to keep myself sharp and my feet firmly on the ground - to consolidate my understanding of the intuition behind these algorithms and encode it in the form of plain source code with minimal dependencies.

**To implement is to understand.**

## Should I use these implementations in production

**No.**

The source code of algorithms and data structures in this repository is likely inefficient and suboptimal. It may also contain various bugs and badly managed corner-cases. Its purpose is purely educational.
